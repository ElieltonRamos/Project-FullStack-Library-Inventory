   ```


It is necessary to provide a PostgreSQL database for this backend

- you can install and start postgre locally
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- or you can use docker to create a container with postgreSQL

- [How to install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)


```bash
docker run --name db_inventory -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Start the backend application by running the following command in the terminal:

   ``` bash
    npm run dev
   ```

Start the frontend application by running the following command in the terminal:

   ``` bash
    cd .. && cd frontend-library-inventory && npm run dev
